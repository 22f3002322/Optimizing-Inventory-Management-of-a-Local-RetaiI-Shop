# 📊 Optimizing Inventory Management

This repository contains the end-to-end analysis of inventory and sales data for **Anand Steel Emporium**, carried out as part of my BDM Capstone Project.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Small retail businesses often face challenges in managing stock due to **reactive restocking** and **lack of demand forecasting**.  
This project uses data-driven techniques to:
- Identify top revenue-generating products
- Optimize restocking patterns
- Improve inventory control using **ABC Analysis, Pareto Principle, and RFM Analysis**
- Provide **SMART actionable recommendations** for better inventory management.

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values, date conversions, and duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Year-wise sales trends, restocking behavior, daily sales patterns.
3. **ABC Analysis**
   - Categorized products into A, B, and C based on Annual Consumption Value.
4. **Pareto Analysis**
   - Verified 80/20 rule for both sales value and sales volume.
5. **RFM Analysis**
   - Measured customer/product behavior based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.

## 📈 Key Results
- A-category products (`Pressure Cooker`, `Induction Cooktop`, `Non-Stick Tawa`, etc.) contribute ~80% of value.
- Restocking patterns are highly inconsistent, leading to potential stockouts and cash flow problems.
- Pareto Analysis validated the 80/20 rule in both volume & value.
- RFM Analysis revealed high preference for `Electric Kettle`, `Utensil Set`, and `Mixer Grinder`, while low-RFM products (`Plastic Jars`, `Serving Trays`) have weak demand.

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- Implement **ABC-based replenishment** for A items.
- Digitize inventory using Excel/Google Sheets.
- Conduct **weekly stock reviews** instead of ad-hoc restocking.
- Negotiate bulk discounts for A-items.
- Phase out C-category products.
